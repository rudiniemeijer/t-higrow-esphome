# T-HiGrow for ESPhome and Home Assistant

The LilyGo T-HiGrow device has been designed to work on a single LiPo battery. The incorporated ESP32 microcontroller has a deep sleep mode that is supported by ESPhome. Getting the sensors to work after deep sleep has proven to be something of a challenge. This configuration file is a succesful implementation of getting all the sensors to work reliably, while reducing the power to almost nothing once in deep sleep.
