# T-HiGrow for ESPhome and Home Assistant

The LilyGo T-HiGrow device has been designed to work on a single LiPo battery. The incorporated ESP32 microcontroller has a deep sleep mode that is supported by ESPhome. Getting the sensors to work after deep sleep has proven to be something of a challenge. This configuration file is a succesful implementation of getting all the sensors to work reliably, while reducing the power to almost nothing once in deep sleep.

## DHT11 temperature and air humidity sensor
The DHT11 sensor is factory calibrated and outputs serial data through a single data pin. The data pin from the DHT11 is connected to GPIO16 of the ESP32 microcontroller. The output given by the data pin is 8 bit humidity integer data + 8 bit the humidity fractional data + 8 bit temperature integer data + 8 bit fractional temperature data + 8 bit parity bit. The DHT11 has been specified with an operating current of 0.3 mA and a standby current of 60 µA. Its temperature range is 0 °C - 50 °C and its humidity range 20% to 90%, with a ±1 °C and ±1 % accuracy.

## BH1750 illuminance sensor
The BH1750 sensor measures light and has a I2C interface. The SDA pin is connected to GPIO25 and the SCL pin is connected to GPIO26.

## ADC battery voltage

## ADC capacitive soil moisture

## ADC resistive salt
